Gut-brain axis knowledge graph(GBA-KG) is a knowledge graph that integrates existingknowledge graphs in the biomedical field and information on microbiology and psychiatry in the literature. GBA-KG integrates a large number of biomedical resources, describing the relationship between microorganisms, genes, diseases, anatomy, compounds, molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components and pathways, expanding the knowledge map in microbial psychiatric diseases. We describe the process from prototyping GBA-KG to information extraction and information updating. It is convenient for researchers to learn, and multi-modal analysis can be combined with machine learning algorithms in the future.
